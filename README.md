## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Doing this challenge helped me to acquire more knowledge about flexbox. I think I understand how to center div now :laughing:

### Continued development

In my future projects I want to learn more about media queries, image sizes and CSS in general, I am struggling a bit with these.

### Useful resources

- [Jenny Mikac github](https://github.com/maudlinmandrake) - This helped me when i got stuck. Thanks Jenny.
- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
